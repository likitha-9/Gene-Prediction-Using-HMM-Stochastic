Human DNA:
prediction for unplaced scaffolds

States: list of amino acids (observations.py)
Hidden ones: A, C, G, T
Goal: predict which homosapien chromosome each unplaced scaffold belongs to

Deadline: ~April 29, 2020

Questions ----> 
--- How to determine which particular sequence falls under a certain chromosome?
--- So far, all data is from homosapiens. Try perhaps other organisms' DNAs? But might need massive computing power (??)

=============================================================================

Issues:
1. Scalability
--- severe underflow errors (due to multiplication of multiple probabilities (state transitions)
tackle by taking logs or scaling, account for loss of precision
--- large datasets are impossible to compute (some sequences are >248M in length)

2. Map amino acid ---> DNA codon. (See which amino acid constitutes of which DNA codons)

3. Sequence of amino acid - initial state of probabilities

4. Stop codon (*) - significance...??

5. Use sequence test sets mentioned in the progress report

6. Test these sequences first: all 23 chromosomes, sequence length: ~1K - 10K

7. Viterbi - could be potentially expensive
