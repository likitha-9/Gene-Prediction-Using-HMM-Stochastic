Human DNA:
prediction for unplaced scaffolds

States: list of amino acids (observations.py)
Hidden ones: A, C, G, T
Goal: predict which homosapien chromosome each unplaced scaffold belongs to

Deadline: ~April 29, 2020

Questions ----> 
--- How to determine which particular sequence falls under a certain chromosome?
--- So far, all data is from homosapiens. Try perhaps other organisms' DNAs? But might need massive computing power (??)
