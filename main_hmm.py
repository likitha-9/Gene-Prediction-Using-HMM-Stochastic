Q = distinct states of the Markov process
V = set of possible observations
A = state transition probabilities
B = observation probability matrix
pi = initial state distribution
O = observation sequence

T - (multiple)
N - list of amino acids - observations.py (??)
M - 
Q - all states from N (??)
V - chrosomes in homosapiens (1-23)
A - computed from the initial matrix
